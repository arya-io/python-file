# Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes.

# Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:

# H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# Helloworld

for i in range(len(s)):
    if i % 2 == 0:
