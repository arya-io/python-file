# The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:

# f(n)=0 if n=0
# f(n)=1 if n=1
# f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
# Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

# 7
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13

def f(n):
    if n == 0: return 0
    elif n == 1: return 1
    else: return f(n-1)+f(n-2)

n=int(input())
values = [str(f(x)) for x in range(0, n+1)]
print(",".join(values))
