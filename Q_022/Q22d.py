# Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. 
# The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
# Then, the output should be:

# 2:2
# 3.:1
# 3?:1
# New:1
# Python:5
# Read:1
# and:1
# between:1
# choosing:1
# or:2
# to:1

from collections import Counter

ss = input().split()
ss = Counter(ss)         # returns key & frequency as a dictionary
ss = sorted(ss.items())  # returns as a tuple list

for i in ss:
    print("%s:%d"%(i[0],i[1]))
