# The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:

# f(n)=0 if n=0
# f(n)=1 if n=1
# f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
# Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

# 7
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 13

n = int(input())
f = lambda x: 0 if x == 0 else 1 if x == 1 else f(x-1)+f(x-2)
print(','.join([str(f(x)) for x in range(0, n+1)]))
