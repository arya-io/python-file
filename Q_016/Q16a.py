# Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. 
# The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers. 
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
# Then, the output should be:

# 1,9,25,49,81

lst = [str(int(i)**2) for i in input().split(',') if int(i) % 2]
print(",".join(lst))
